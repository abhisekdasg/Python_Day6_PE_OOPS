    "    Scenario: You are tasked with designing a class hierarchy for an online shopping cart system. The system should handle products, shopping carts, and orders. Consider various OOP principles while designing this system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Create a class hierarchy that includes classes for products (e.g., Product), shopping carts (e.g., ShoppingCart), and orders (e.g., Order). Define attributes and methods for each class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2. Implement encapsulation by making relevant attributes private and providing getter and setter methods where necessary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Use inheritance to represent different types of products (e.g., electronics, clothing) as subclasses of the Product class. Ensure that each product type can have specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Demonstrate polymorphism by allowing various product types to be added to a shopping cart and calculate the total cost of items in the cart.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    5. Implement a method for placing an order, which transfers items from the shopping cart to an order.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Consider scenarios like out-of-stock products, discounts, and shipping costs in your design.\n"
